        A function that handles the process of converting an image to text. It allows the user to upload an image or provide an image URL. The function then processes the image to extract text content. If an image is uploaded, it retrieves the image data and passes it to the image_to_text_api to generate the text content. If an image URL is provided, it downloads the image data, saves it locally, and then uses the image_to_text_api to generate the text content.
